This API handles creating users.

Users are created by POST'ing json to the root url that includes:
* name
* email
* password
* password_confirmation

All attributes are required, and email will be checked for uniqueness and that it is well-formed.

The response is a json object that includes:
* id of the new user record
* name
* email
* authentication_token

The authentication token is generated when saving the user record.
